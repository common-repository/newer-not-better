Prevents selected plugins bugging you about updates

== Description ==

Sometimes newer isn't always better.

You won't always want to update a given plugin. Perhaps the design has been changed, or a bug has been introduced. Maybe it has been taken over by someone new and they've added loads of obnoxious ads or other sneaky monetisation methods. Or perhaps you just like it the way it is.

However, WP keeps telling you there's a new version available, and lists it along with other plugins which you may actually want to update.

What happens if you accidentally update? At best, it's a tedious downgrade process, at worst it may completely mess up the data that the plugin was using. In any case, it's a pain and there's no ignore update function in WP.

*Until now!*

**IMPORTANT** - You should only leave a plugin updated if you know what you are doing, familiar with the risks and willing to accept the consequences should an unpatched vulnerability be exploited on your site.

**The plugin author cannot be held responsible for any loss or damages that occur as a result of using this plugin to disregard software updates!**

== Installation ==

1. Unpack the entire contents of this plugin zip file into your wp-content/plugins/ folder locally
2. Upload to your site
3. Navigate to wp-admin/plugins.php on your site (your WP plugin page)
4. Activate this plugin. 

OR you can just install it with WordPress by going to Plugins >> Add New >> and type this pluginâ€™s name

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it safe to disable updates to a plugin? =

Usually not. Almost all plugins have vulnerabilities, and these are patched when they are updated. By not updating you are leaving yourself open to possible vulnerabilities.

**You should only leave a plugin on an old version if you know what you are doing, familiar with the risks and willing to accept the consequences should an unpatched vulnerability be exploited on your site.**

= Can I select all plugins? =

You can, although it's not recommended. This is only for plugins that you have a specific reason not to update. Most are well maintained, play nice and updates are usually better.

Turning off updates on all plugins represents a large security risk to your site.

= Can I re-enable updates to a plugin? =

Of course, just remove it in the options page.

= Can I buy you a coffee for helping me avoid annoying updates / notifications =

You don't have to, but if you would like to buy me a coffee, beer, breakfast or more please visit https://adamainsworth.co.uk/donate

= What features will you add in the future? =

Changing the options interface so that you can see the friendly name of the plugin in addition to its path, and also have a more user-friendly checkbox system.

I will also add the ability to enable / disable updates directly from the plugins page.
